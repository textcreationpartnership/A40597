            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Full and True RELATION OF THE Remarkable Fight BETWIXT Capt. HAMILTON and Capt. BROWN, Commanders of the Two <hi>Scotch</hi> FRIGATS, AND Three <hi>French</hi> Men of WAR, <hi>That brought over the</hi> IRISH <hi>Men to Joyn</hi> Dundee <hi>in the</hi> Weſtern <hi>Sea, as it was delivered to ſome of the Privy Counſellors in</hi> Scotland, <hi>by thoſe that were Eye Witneſſes during the whole Action.</hi> LICENSED <hi>Aug. 2. 1689. J. Fraſer.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IN regard that the Bravery and Gallantneſs of the laſt Actions of Captain <hi>Hamilton</hi> and Captain <hi>Brown's</hi> Lives are ſo Remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable, and not frequently paralell'd, I think it not amiſs to give you a particular and diſtinct Account of them, as it was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to ſome Members of the Privy-Council here, by one of the Lieutenants of thoſe Frigats that had the good Fortune to come off after he had been taken Priſoner, and by other perſons now in Town, who were preſent, and Witneſſes of what paſt, which was thus. On <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the <hi>10th.</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> Captain <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi> Commanding the <hi>Pelican</hi> carrying 18 Guns and 120 Men, and Captain <hi>Brown</hi> in the <hi>Jennet</hi> Frigate carrying 12 Guns and 80 Men, as they were Cruiſing between the Mull of <hi>Kintire</hi> in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Carrichſergus Lough</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> happened to diſcover at Sea to the Southward three Sail of Ships, to whom they immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ply'd up, and when they came within ſuch a diſtance as to be able to diſcern them; they obſerved them to look like En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh built Ships, carrying the Engliſh Flag and Colours, which led them into the miſtake of believing them to be Engliſh and Friends: This obliged them to make up cloſe to them to Salute them; but they did not ſooner perceive their Errour, than they
<pb facs="tcp:104498:2"/> found it impoſſible to Retreat; they being three French Men of War, having on Aboard a Battalion of 400 Men of Collonel <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils</hi> Regiment of Foot, that was going to joyn <hi>Dundee;</hi> the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt of them carrying 36 Guns, the Second 30, and the third 24 Guns: And ſo to Action they fell immediately, and fought it with all the Gallantry and Reſolution imaginable with their Guns above an hour; the two leſſer Frigats fell to Captain <hi>Brown</hi>'s ſhare to engage with, and when his Main Maſt was ſhot down, they came and lay aboard him, in which Action his Right Arm was ſhot off with a Canon Bullet, yet notwithſtanding he maintained the Fight Reſolutely, and continued giving directions and Orders to his Men, untill he received ſeven Musket Bullets in his Body, the laſt of which killed him dead, one <hi>Cambell</hi> his Lieutenant maintain'd the Fight with the ſame Gallantry, until be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over power'd by the Enemies men, who after great ſlaughters coming on board found the Lieutenant lying on the Deck, Shot throught the right Thigh, the right Shoulder, and left Arm, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only 14 Men alive, whereof 8 were wounded and diſabled. Captain <hi>Brown</hi>'s Ship being thus taken, theſe two Frigats Joyn the great one, and all three fall on Captain <hi>Hamilton,</hi> who made his part good againſt the French Man alone, and when his Ship had been much batter'd and torn, the two biggeſt Ships came and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to board him; and with them he fought a conſiderable time, his Ship being better provided for a cloſe Fight then Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Brown's</hi> was, he had the misfortune to be thrice boarded by the Enemy, and the Courage to clear his Deck as often of them. At laſt his Forecaſtle and Steerage being torn open by the violence and frequency of the Enemies Shot, and the hand gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadoes doing much miſchief to his Men, the Enemy boarded him the fourth time in great Numbers, ſo that looking upon himſelf and his Ship for loſt, as his laſt affort, gave orders to his Gunner to go down to the hold and blow up the Ship; and he no ſooner gave the word of Command for Executing what he had purpoſed to do, but a Cannon Bullet at random Shot from the third Ship, came and diſpatcht him, and hindred his laſt orders from being obey'd. And ſo his Ship fell into the Enemies hands, and of the 120 Men he had on board, only 30 Men were found alive, whereof the greateſt part were wounded and much diſabled. In this Action there were killed of our People, the two Captains, one hundred and fifty Six Men; and of the Enemies one French Captain, two Lieutenants, two hundred and Eighteen Men, and many wounded.</p>
            <p>This Account we have from ſome that were taken and now have made their Eſcape, and from thoſe that have been aboard the French Ship ſince the Action, as alſo from ſome of thoſe Iriſh that were taken priſoners ſince that time, all their Relations agreeing as above is mentioned.</p>
